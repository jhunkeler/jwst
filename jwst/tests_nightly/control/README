JWST REGTEST DIRECTORY
--

This directory comes from file:///data1/svn_rt_jwst/control - that
repository contains only the control portions of the regtest.

Run the tests with ./rt

It runs tests in subdirectories that come from other places:

general
	general jwst regtests; add new tests to the subversion repository
	file:///data1/svn_rt_jwst/ in the directory general/

	Add new tests by:

		cd general
		mkdir ...
		cd ...
		svn add yourtest
		svn commit

		DO add:
			- test files
			- input files

		DO NOT add:
			- output files
			- reference files

		DO NOT:
			- modify any input files during the test



jwst_alive
	irafdev regtests; add new tests under here ONLY if they should
	run on every machine/architecture in the nightly tests.  Remember
	that not all test machines can run jwst code because of memory
	limitations.
	file:///eng/ssb/tests/svnrt/rt/jwst_alive

more_tests
	If your package contains a more_tests directory, it will be
	copied into here by the nightly builds.  This is for tests
	that the user will not install, but that you may distribute
	to the user.

	This directory is not stored in subversion.

test_functions
	for packages that have a .test() function, this directory is
	automatically populated with a series of tests that run those
	functions.  If those functions follow the convention at 
	http://ssb.stsci.edu/testing/pandokia/docs_new/helper_testfn.html
	they will show up in the pandokia report.


Note also /data4/jwst_test_data is a place to store large data files
outside subversion.  See /data4/jwst_test_data/README
