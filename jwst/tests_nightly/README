What is here
------------

control/
	This is the top level of the jwst tests.  It contains the scripts
	that control the running of the nightly tests, but NOT the tests.

general/
	This is a general directory of tests.

There are other tests not in this repository.


Normally, you would do this:

	svn checkout file:///data1/svn_rt_jwst/control jwst_rt
	cd jwst_rt
	bin/checkout
